# Django-Library-Manager-App
Powerful Library Management App

This App is made to manage the Library. It has the following features so far:
- Login for Library Staff Members and Library Members(students)
  - Staff Members: They can update, delete or create authors, books. Can renew the book to a borrower and view all the borrowers.
  - Library Members: They can view all the books, authors, copies total and available.
- Admin Panel for Admin or Staff members to add, update, delete users.
- Doesn't give sign up feature to students as the username would be provided by the school or college itself(Else the students of other school or college may also signup).
